# COVID19

The most up to date app is located in the COVID-19 folder. This folder contains a global.R, server.R, and ui.R file. 
These files contain the most up to date CHAD application. Ensure you have all packages installed and loaded.
We have been using the most up to date version of R for the application. Note we are still updating it daily, so there may be issues. 
If you experience issues, email me at trey.pujats@afit.edu or tpujats@gmail.com and I will send you working code for the app or update the current code.
